adding   a   label   to   a   node
adding   an   invalid   label   to   a   node
adding   constraints   should   be   idempotent
adding   multiple   labels   to   a   node
addinga composite indexing rule should succeed
addinga label that already exists behaves as no op
addinga label to pre existing node should get indexed
addinga label using an invalid identifier should fail
addinga label usinga valid identifier should succeed
adding an already added label when labels are in dynamic records should fail
adding an already added label when labels are inlined should fail
adding an indexing rule in nested tx should succeed
adding an indexing rule should succeed
addinga node with property should get indexed
adding constraint when already constrained gives nice error

adding elements change size
adding index when already constrained
adding index when already indexed
adding queries keeps insert order
adding relationship property existence constraint constraint should be idempotent
